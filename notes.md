## React Components and Templates
 > sidebar, navbar, title bar all are components

 > components contains both
 TEMPLATES and LOGIC
 TEMPLATES - UI part
 LOGIC - javascript working

 > index.html contains the <App /> component which is an App.js file that is root component

 > it contains function App which can be also an arrow function that returns jsx template similar to that of html 
 babel script converts jsx to html

 > main diff between jsx and html is the use of className instead of class which is a reserved keyword

```react
    //export default App;
    // to import a react component
    // import App from './App'
    // where App is from from file App.js 

```
